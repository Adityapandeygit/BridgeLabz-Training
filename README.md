## 📅 Week 4 – OOPs Keywords & Object Behavior

**[1 January 2026]**

---

## 1 January 2026 (Thursday)

### OOPs Concepts – `this`, `static`, `final` & `instanceof`

Studied and practiced core **Object-Oriented Programming keywords and operators** that define object behavior, memory management, and runtime type handling in Java.  
Hands-on programs were implemented to clearly understand real-world usage and best practices.
**Concepts Covered:**
- Final variables (constants)
- Final methods (prevent overriding)
- Final classes (prevent inheritance)

**Key Learnings:**
- Creating immutable values
- Ensuring method behavior consistency
- Designing secure and non-extendable classes

---

### 🔹 `instanceof` Operator

The `instanceof` operator is used for **runtime type checking** in inheritance hierarchies.

**Key Learnings:**
- Safe type casting in polymorphism
- Preventing `ClassCastException`
- Checking parent–child relationships at runtime

---

### ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Strong understanding of **object reference and identity**
- Clear distinction between **class-level vs instance-level behavior**
- Improved code safety using `final`
- Confident runtime type checks using `instanceof`
- Better JVM memory and design awareness
